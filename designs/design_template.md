# Design Document: [Feature/Project Name]

## Overview
<!-- High-level summary of the design.
Why is this needed? What problem does it solve? What are the goals and non-goals? -->

## Background / Problem Statement
<!-- Current state of the system.
What issues or gaps exist? Why is this important to solve now? -->

## Glossary
<!-- Define key terms and concepts that may not be obvious to all readers. -->
- **Term**: Definition

## Requirements
### Functional
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2

### Non-Functional
- [ ] Performance, reliability, scalability, etc.

### Latency / Performance Targets
- Current performance: X
- Target performance: Y

## Out of Scope
<!-- Explicitly list what this design does NOT cover, to avoid scope creep. -->

## Design
<!-- Detailed explanation of the proposed design.
Include diagrams, code snippets, data flows, APIs, edge cases, etc. -->

## Alternatives Considered
<!-- Other approaches evaluated, and why they were not chosen. -->

## Security / Privacy Considerations
<!-- Any risks related to data, security, or privacy. -->

## Dependencies / Compatibility
<!-- External services, libraries, or versions this depends on.
Consider backward compatibility and migration needs. -->

## Implementation Plan
<!-- Step-by-step plan:
  - Phase 1: Code
  - Phase 2: Integration
  - Phase 3: Testing
  - Phase 4: Rollout
  - Phase 5: Enhancements -->

## Testing
<!-- How correctness will be verified.
Include test plan, benchmarks, regression tests, load testing, etc. -->

## Monitoring & Observability
<!-- Metrics, logs, and dashboards to track after rollout. -->

## Rollout
<!-- Plan for rollout:
staged releases, feature flags, backward compatibility, rollback strategy, etc. -->

## Community Impact
<!-- Effects on users, contributors, downstream projects.
Any migration paths or breaking changes? -->
